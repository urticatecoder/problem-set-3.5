    <h1>Play Station 4: Exclusive Titles Galore</h1>
    <p>Sony’s Playstation has been gaining ground in terms of market share in recent years, and there seems to be good reason why. The system is easy to use full of big exclusive titles. It may be blander than an Xbox on the surface, but once you dive into games, you’ll never notice the difference. And while the Xbox certainly has some advantages over its planer sibling, the Playstation has a few tricks up its sleeve.</p>

    <h3>Pros</h3>
      <ul>
        <li id="ps4list">As of now, (October 3, 2018) Playstation offers the most graphically powerful console on the market: the Playstation 4 Pro. Yes, Microsoft has plans to release their Xbox Project Scorpio, but it’ll be limited edition, and substantially more expensive than the PS4 Pro. If you’ve decided on going with a console instead of a PC and you want a cutting edge setup, Playstation is the way to go.</li>
        <li id="ps4list">Ahh yes, we return to exclusives. But this time it’ll stay in the Pros category. To be sure, which exclusives you value most is entirely subjective, but of all the big release exclusive titles, most of them have been on Sony’s platform (at least in recent years). Two great examples of this that have also been mentioned elsewhere in this website are God of War, and Marvel’s Spiderman. Always judge exclusive titles by which ones you’ll actually play, but if you don’t have your eye on any titles in particular and you simply want to be open to the most exclusive titles down the line, then Playstation is the way to go.</li>
        <li id="ps4list">Playstations are also quite small compared to PCs, especially with the newest PS4 model which is even smaller than the Xbox One S. If you have space constraints, or don’t have room for a full-sized PC, then a console might be your only option.</li>
        <li id="ps4list">Just like with Xboxes, a playstation is designed for local multiplayer use, giving it an edge over PCs if you regularly have groups over to play games.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li id="ps4list">Playstation controllers are wide and more uncomfortable to handle than Xbox ones. It isn’t like you’ll get hand cramps if you use them for too long; they’re by no means uncomfortable. But if your goal is to get the console with the BEST feeling controller, Playstation probably isn’t the right choice. However, like excitement about exclusives, controller comfort is subjective, so make sure to test out all controllers at stores or friends’ houses before making a purchase decision.</li>
        <li id="ps4list">Playstations also come with all of the natural downsides that a console has compared to a PC: lesser performance, decreased customization, lack of versatility, etc.</li>
      </ul>
