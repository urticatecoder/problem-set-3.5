      <h2 style="text-align:center;">Console vs. PC Gaming: What's Your Best Choice?</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>The four device types I'll be comparing in this website are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li style="font-weight:bold;">Personal Computers (PCs)</li>
        <li>Sony Playstation</li>
        <li>Microsoft Xbox</li>
        <li>Nintendo Switch</li>
      </ol>

    <p class="homepg"> If you don’t feel like getting into the nitty gritty details of comparing the different consoles and PCs you can just read this paragraph. So what’s the verdict? Is there a true best option for the prospective buyer? Of course not. Just like with anything else, different options have different pros and cons and each platform has some advantages over the rest. But nothing stands out as “the best” and the decision of what gaming machine to purchase ultimately varies on a case by case basis. In the end, it’s up to the consumer to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each option, and decide which strengths are the most important to them and which they’re willing to sacrifice.<br><br>If you’re looking to buy a machine that’ll give you the best performance in games regardless of other factors, buy a PC. High-end PCs can play games at several hundred frames per second, even at high resolutions. If you’re looking for a machine that you can use for things other than gaming, like work or creative tasks, go with a PC still. Computers come with full operating systems that can complete many jobs. If you’re looking for a system that you can freely customize the hardware and software of in any way you want, a PC is the choice for you.<br><br>But, if you only need a system for gaming, and you value smaller sizes, cheaper costs, and multiplayer orientation, than a console is the way to go. Within the console heading, there are several options, and there are multiple things to consider when comparing them. All consoles have exclusive games, so if you’re buying a console to play a specific game make sure to check which platforms support it. If you don’t have any specific exclusive titles in mind and you just want to go with a console that is likely to have the best exclusives in the future, a Playstation is your safest bet. If you want a console that engages you physically and involves fun movement tasks, definitely go with a Switch. If you’re looking for a platform with the most comfortable controllers, you’ll probably want an Xbox, but make sure to test different controller types before your purchase to be sure.<br><br>Beyond these things, other determining factors come in the form of pure subjectivity. If you’ve used Xboxes your whole life, and have no reason to switch over other than out of curiosity, stick with Xboxes. It’s always better to choose the option that you’re familiar with instead of risking not liking the choice you made. If all of your friends have playstations and you want to be able to play online with them, then choose a playstation, unless you have a more important reason to go with something else. If you like Nintendo’s game universe and you’re invested in the Mario series, choose a Switch. In the end, it’s unlikely that you won’t be happy with whatever choice you make. Just be sure to do research before your purchase, and choose to prioritize those things that you have identified as most important to you.
