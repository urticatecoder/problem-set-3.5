    <h1 style="text-align:center;">PC: Versatile Multitasking in a Customizable Package</h1>
    <p>If you’re looking for an all-encompassing solution, PCs are objectively the right choice. Investing in a nice PC will give you a device on which you can play games, do work, consume media, create media, and more. Additionally, PCs generally offer better performance over their console counterparts, but they will almost always cost more.</p>

    <h3 style="font-weight: bold">Pros</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A PC is a versatile machine that allows its user to perform all kinds of tasks. Where consoles are essentially limited to gaming and minor media consumption, (through apps like Netflix) PCs open up a whole new world. You can of course play the same games on computers that you can on consoles, and you can certainly use apps like Netflix to watch movies and TV shows. But being on a computer gives you access to so much more. Software like Excel, Word, and Powerpoint can be downloaded to allow for data management and other work-related tasks. Video and photo editing softwares can be used for creative endeavors and professional use. Nearly endless research can be done on any conceivable topic, and wireless communication is enabled between you and anyone else with a computer. In short, PCs are devices for those who want to do more than just gaming, and they can be used for personal, professional, creative, or entertainment purposes.</li>
        <li>PC controls are another strong point for them. While there are some games like platform fighters and Rocket League for which a controller is superior, most games, including all shooter games, can be played more effectively on a keyboard and mouse. This is due to the minute subtlety that can be required for quick reaction shots in FPS games. Where pushing a controller’s toggle will cause a substantial movement of the crosshair, mouse movement can be controlled in infinitesimally small increments. Additionally, for games that have many different actions, keyboards have a large number of keys, each of which can be assigned to a different task. To play those same games on consoles, increasingly convoluted button combination inputs must be used.</li>
        <li>PCs generally offer stronger performance over consoles in terms of their computing power. With higher end processors, faster ram, and beastly graphics chips, top-tier PCs can push out over 100 frames per second, even in 4k. This is far superior to the measly performances of most modern consoles which don’t play games at any resolution beyond 1080p.</li>
        <li>PCs offer a much higher degree of customizability than consoles. Whether you buy a prebuilt model or build one yourself, you can customize practically any aspect of the hardware or software you want. For example, you can change your computer’s case to alter its overall aesthetic, or add lights to it if you want more pizzazz. Similarly, you can install whatever operating system you want (even Mac OS) and download software for any task. None of this is available on consoles, where hardware and software customization options are essentially nonexistent.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3 style="font-weight: bold">Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>One downside to buying a computer instead of a console is that you’re almost guaranteed to spend more money. While it is possible to build a PC that performs as effectively as or better than a console for the same price, it requires incredibly meticulous part choice, not to mention the fact that some people are uncomfortable building a computer from scratch. In general, you may be getting a machine that’s much more versatile than a console, but you’re paying extra for that versatility. As such, if you already have a computer for daily tasks, and you don’t need exceptional gaming performance, a new PC might not be the way to go.</li>
        <li>PCs are inherently averse to local multiplayer, especially compared to consoles. Yes, you can connect controllers to your computer in order to play games with multiple people, but it’s done on a smaller screen, and many wireless controllers require adapters for use with PCs. A console on the other hand is connected to a TV (larger screen) right from the get go, is designed to work with any number of wireless controllers, and features games that are designed for multiple people. If you are the kind of person who frequently has groups of people over to play video games, a console seems like the clear choice.</li>
        <li>There are exclusive titles on any platform, including many on platforms other than PCs. If you’re primary reason for getting a gaming machine is to play a specific game, make sure to check which platforms support that game. To be sure, there is a large market of indie games available only on PC, but many large title’s like Marvel’s Spiderman are only available on specific consoles (Playstation 4).</li>
