    <h1>Nintendo Consoles: Activity in a Unique Package</h1>
    <p>You may have noticed that in the first three tabs of this website, I mostly compared PCs, playstations, and Xboxes amongst themselves. As a matter of fact, I haven’t mentioned Nintendo consoles at any point before this. That’s because what nintendo’s consoles offer is completely unique. While they don’t have many of the same titles that other platforms do, they’re built for a different kind of gaming. Large multiplayer groups and active motion-based games are Nintendo’s specialty, and over the years, they’ve mastered their craft.</p>

    <h3>Pros</h3>
      <ul>
        <li style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 15px;" id="ninlist">Nintendo has perfected the art of motion-based gameplay. This can be seen through the ages, with the Wii and its Fitboard, all the way to the current Switch and its motion-sensitive controllers. Game like WiiFit and WiiSports required the user to put in physical action, and games like 1 2 Switch require the same thing of users today. Not only can this be a fun way to get minor exercise, but it can actually increase the levels of fun from playing video games.</li>
        <li id="ninlist">There are many time-honored exclusives on Nintendo systems, all part of a universe that exists only on the Wii. Mario Kart, Super Mario Bros, and Super Mario Galaxy are just a few of the Mario-Luigi games that many fans adore, and other serieses like the Legend of Zelda exist only on Nintendo systems.</li>
        <li id="ninlist">Nintendo consoles like the Wii U can connect up to 8 people at a time for some games, twice the number of people that can connect at once to a Playstation or Xbox. If you’re having large groups of people over and all of them want to play party games at once, the Nintendo Switch might be the choice for you.</li>
        <li id="ninlist">Nintendo also has portability on its side. While all consoles are more portable than a most PCs, Nintendo takes this to another level with devices like the DS. DS systems are entirely portable devices the size of cell phones that allow you to purchase game cartridges and play whatever you want on a screen that has a controller built in. And Nintendo’s current flagship console, the Switch, is essentially a tablet with controllers that can be attached to either side of the screen. In this way, the Switch can be taken with you in order to be played on the go.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li id="ninlist">Generally, Nintendo consoles are less graphically powerful than their Microsoft and Sony counterparts, and they’re always less powerful than PCs. The games they run generally don’t require powerful systems, but if you want the sharpest graphics available, a Nintendo machine might not be for you.</li>
        <li id="ninlist">The Switch offers selection from an exceptionally and notoriously small catalogue of games. In addition to the limited selection overall, some game types are almost nowhere to be found on Switch. Generally, Nintendo’s platform is more PG rated, so there aren’t as many games that feature gore and violence available on the Nintendo platform.</li>
        <li id="ninlist">As compared to a PC,  a switch will offer less customizability, fewer games overall, slower hardware, and more limited software. If you’re shooting for a superior gaming experience, the Switch will never be your console of choice.</li>
      </ul>
