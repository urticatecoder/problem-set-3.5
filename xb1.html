    <h1 style="text-align:center;">XBox One: Comfortable Controllers, Sleek Style</h1>
      <p>The opposites of many of the factors that count as cons for PCs can be found in the pros section of consoles like Xbox, Playstation, and Nintendo. Consoles are centrally designed around presenting a machine whose sole focus is to play video games well. Xbox is a specific brand of console produced by Microsoft, and over the years, it has built up a substantial following of fans who prefer its ecosystem to any other.</p>

    <h3 style="font-weight: bold">Pros</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Depending on personal preferences, the Xbox’s ecosystem / operating system could either be a pro or a con. Some people have become so invested in the use of it that it seems almost unthinkable to switch to something else. As a user of both Playstations and Xboxes, I can say from personal experience that the “look and feel” of the Playstation’s GUI is much more bland than that of the Xbox, which features a grid-style layout with big colorful pictures plastered throughout.</li>
        <li>As mentioned on the PC page, every platform has its fair share of exclusive titles. Some popular ones on Xbox include Dead or Alive 3, and Forza Motorsport. Of course, this may be inconsequential to you if these aren’t games you play, but make sure to figure out what platforms support a game before you buy a device to play that game.</li>
        <li>The Xbox’s controller is, again, a point of subjectivity. Personal preferences can vary vastly and are the sole determiner of whether this category falls in the Pros list or Cons list. In my personal opinion, Xbox controllers are much more comfortable to hold for a long period of time. The controller is narrower relative to its height than a Playstation controller is, and the curves of the grip fit my hands ergonomically. Additionally, I have found it to be the case that most people tend to prefer Xbox controllers to Playstation ones, so keep that in mind when you’re making a purchase decision.</li>
        <li>Consoles are also much smaller than PCs in general, so if you have any space constraints, a console is the way to go.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Just as exclusive titles fit into the pros category, they fit into the cons category as well. There are plenty of games that are not available on Xbox, such as God of War which is only available for Playstation, and Zelda Breath of the Wild, which is only available on the Nintendo switch. When looking at exclusive titles, remember not to make your decision based solely on which platform has more, but on which platform has more that you are interested in.</li>
        <li>Xboxes make you pay extra for online access in games, something which is included for free when playing on PC. Keep in mind that when purchasing a new gaming machine, there are often more factors that affect price than one realizes at first. For example, when you settle on the price of a PC, you also have to consider the fact that you must buy a monitor too.</li>
